You are a world-class UI/UX designer and front-end architect tasked with designing a modern, flexible, and elegant document editor system.
The goal is to create an interface that combines the fluid text editing of Notion with the granular table customization of Airtable or Google Sheets, all wrapped in a clean, modern, and classy visual aesthetic.

🧠 Overall Concept

Design a document workspace where users can effortlessly create and style reports — including text sections, financial tables, headers, and footers — with total creative control.
The interface should feel like a hybrid of Notion + Airtable + Apple Pages, combining power with simplicity and elegance.

🎯 Core Objectives

Deliver exceptional UX — smooth, intuitive, and delightful.

Deliver world-class UI design — minimalist, premium, and visually balanced.

Focus on text flexibility, table customization, and template reusability.

🧩 Functional Areas to Design

Main Workspace

Clean, white or dark-neutral background with subtle shadows.

Central editable document area.

Floating formatting toolbar that appears on text or table selection.

Text Editing Zone

Notion-style inline text editor:

Supports bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inline color, and background highlight.

Headers (H1–H6), bullet & numbered lists, quotes, dividers.

Custom fonts, font sizes, and color palettes.

Support headers, footers, and flexible page numbering.

Option to insert page breaks and table of contents dynamically.

Table Editor Zone

Excel/Airtable-inspired table with full customization:

Adjustable row height and column width.

Per-cell font size, text color, background color.

Editable borders (color, thickness, and side selection).

Row-level styling (e.g., bold totals, shaded subtotals).

Ability to drag-and-drop rows to reorder.

Collapsible row hierarchy (Levels L0–L3).

Inline tooltips for quick edit.

Live preview of row formatting as it’s applied.

Template System

Sidebar or modal for selecting pre-made templates (e.g., Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, Project Report).

Users can edit templates, save new ones, and reapply them later.

Include a preview gallery of templates with thumbnails.

Toolbar & Actions

Sleek, contextual toolbar with icons for:

Text styling (bold, italic, underline, color picker).

Table actions (insert row, merge cell, align, border).

Document-level actions (export, undo/redo, templates, save).

Floating toolbar with soft hover animations and rounded corners.

Icons from Lucide or Material icons, monochrome style.

Export and Document Controls

Top-right export button (PDF, JSON, or template).

Optional “Presentation Mode” that hides editing controls.

Auto-save indicator and version info subtly displayed.

🎨 Visual Style & Aesthetic

Color palette: whites, light grays, soft blues, subtle gradients.
(Dark mode variant with charcoal gray and desaturated blues.)

Typography: modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or Poppins).

Design tone: premium, clean, confident — think Linear.app, Apple Pages, or Notion.

Components: rounded corners (12–16px), light shadows, clean spacing.

Micro-interactions: gentle hover effects, smooth transitions, contextual tooltips.

💡 Experience Notes

Every interaction should feel smooth and instant.

Customization options should appear contextually (not cluttered).

Use subtle animations for dropdowns, toolbars, and drag operations.

Maintain pixel-perfect alignment and consistent spacing rhythm.

The user should feel like they are using a professional creative tool, not a spreadsheet.

🧱 Deliverables to Generate

When generating the prototype or design, include:

A full mockup or layout of the workspace.

Example text editing section (like a report introduction).

Example table section with editable rows and styling toolbar.

Template selector preview (with sample financial templates).

Toolbar and sidebar visuals with icons and tooltips.

🔧 Optional Enhancements

Add draggable blocks (like Notion).

Inline comment or annotation system.

Custom branding (logo, color theme).

Adaptive layout for tablets.

✨ Goal

Produce a stunning, modern, and intuitive user interface for a next-generation document & report editor —
a system that feels as flexible as Notion, as powerful as Airtable, and as elegant as Apple.
